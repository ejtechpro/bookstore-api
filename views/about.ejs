    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>
      This website provides a RESTful API interface to a highly detailed
      database of books, built from thousands of lines of data. We focus on a
      vast collection of books, including detailed information on their authors,
      genres, publishers, and more. By using this website, you can access
      information on books, their summaries, ratings, reviews, and additional
      metadata.

    <h3>What is an API?</h3>
    <p>
      An API (Application Programming Interface) allows developers to interact
      with an application through a set of interfaces. In this case, the
      application is a comprehensive database of books, and the interfaces are
      URL links.
    </p>
    <p>
      A RESTful API follows a set of conventions based on HTTP verbs, errors,
      and hyperlinks, making it easier for other applications to consume data.

    <h3>Aren't there already many book websites?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, there are plenty of them! However, each one may have its own version
      of the data. This leads to discrepancies and delays in updating when new
      books or editions are released.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to provide a single, reliable source of book data that other
      websites and applications can use, ensuring consistency and collaboration
      across the industry.

    <h3>Who built this?</h3>
    <p>
      This API was developed by <i>Emmanuel Juma (EJ)</i> as a passion project
      to provide a unified source for book-related data. Over time, we’ve
      expanded the database, improved performance, and collaborated with other
      developers to enhance the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      We welcome contributions from the community, and the current maintainers
      include <i>Jefferson Weeddy</i> who continue to improve and grow the
      project.

    <h3>Where did you get all of this data?</h3>
    <p>We’ve gathered our book information from multiple reliable sources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Public domain data</li>
      <li>Publishers' APIs</li>
      <li>Contributions from authors and readers</li>
      <li>Open data initiatives</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What's the technology stack?</h3>
    <p>
      Our API is originally built using <b>ejs template engine</b>, and we will
      migrated to <b>ReactJs</b> soon, a more scalable solution that serves data
      through static files for improved performance. The platform is hosted on
      <b
        ><a href="https://render.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >render.com</a
        ></b
      >, with a continuous integration <i>CI/CD</i> pipeline to ensure smooth
      deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frontend uses <b>ejs template engine</b>, and the backend is powered
      by <b>Node.js &bull; express framework &bull; MongoDB</b>.
